# AX-1 Robotic Arm (Playing Pegs)

![Alt text](/resources/AX1-Pegs.JPG)

## AX-1 Pegs Game

This project adds functionality to the AX-1 robotic arm, and provides the extra 3d printable parts to get the arm solving puzzles.
This project includes:

- STL files to 3d print the playing board base to mount the AX-1
- STL files to 3d print 7 playing pieces
- Python code tutorial with examples on how to move the arm as required
- Python code to open a user interface window and solve a set game board configuration
- Arduino code to upload to the arduino device

## A little more on building the project. . .

Original design of the arm and board were printed on an Ender-3 Pro, but should work on any correctly set up 3d printer. The additional parts needed will be supplied in a seperate file within this repo, along with places to purchase online. The board originally used was an Arduino Uno, but any Arduino board should work with possible configuration changes (input/output of servos).

The project uses the AX-1 robotic arm, which is an open source project designed using low-cost SG90 servos. The arm was specifically designed to keep the project cost low, and serve as a learning platform to introduce robotics and coding to people would like a great place to start.

## Using this design

This design is free to use for non-profit and educational uses. If you would like to discuss other use cases, contact me '@gmail.com'. If you would like to contribute or add additional functionality to be included in this project, get in touch!
